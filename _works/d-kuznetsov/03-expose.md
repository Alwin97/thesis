## Titel: State-of-the-Art approach to working with sounds on the web

Supported by all modern browsers, the Web Audio API is a powerful and versatile web audio management system that allows developers to select audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, apply spatial effects, and more. At the same time, many web developer guides are limited to mentioning the audio tag and its attributes.

This master's work sets the following goals.
- Give a brief overview of the history of working with audio on the web.
- Explore in detail the modern capabilities of the Web Audio API and prepare an example of its use.
- Try to describe how the Web audio API will change in the future

At the beginning, it will be explore how the working with sound in the web has changed up to the present. Topics such as the use of special tags and Flash will be mentioned. Particular attention will be paid to the disadvantages of such approaches to working with sound.

Next, a modern approach to working with sound, which is based on the HTML5 standard, will be studied in detail. In addition, a real example of using the modern audio API will be prepared.

At the end, an attempt will be made to find out how working with sound will change in the near future. To do this, proposals and current bugs in the Web API will be studied.
